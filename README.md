## Introduction
Hangman is a classic word game in which you must guess as many secret words as you can before time runs out! Challenge your friends and learn new words, one letter at a time!

## Installation
To install and run this game, you'll need a C++ compiler. Here are the steps to get it up and running:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Acidicts/Hangman.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:

    ```
4. Run the game:
    ```
    ./hangman

After running the game, you'll be presented with a series of underscores representing the hidden word. Your task is to guess the word one letter at a time. Be careful, though, as incorrect guesses will bring the hangman closer to his demise!
